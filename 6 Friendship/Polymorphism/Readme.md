# Polymorphism
C++ was designed to simplify the process of coding from the human's perspective, so it was structured around encapsulating functions in classes and objects to reduce the cognitive complexity of coding. To this end, one strategy that C++ takes is to allow for multiple things (_poly_) to take on many shapes (_morph_). We've come across this several times, which is formally termed _polymorphism_. In C++ polymorphism covers the following behaviors:
1. [Function Overloading](../../3%20Intermediate%20Functions/Function%20Overloading)
2. [Operator Overloading](../../6%20Friendship/Operator%20Overloading)
3. [Function Overriding](../../6%20Friendship/Function%20Overriding)
4. [Virtual Functions](../../6%20Friendship/Virtual%20Functions)
  
We've covered them all across the different sections, so you can re-visit them from here.
